					Hello!
					<br></br>I am Hannah Bee from Wellington New Zealand. <br></br> <br></br>I began
					my journey as a dev in April of 2022 after dabbling in illustration, writing,
					photography and graphic design for years.<br></br>I graduated fromÂ Dev Academy
					bootcamp in July 2022 and since then have been continuing to explore what I
					enjoy most about coding. <br></br>
					<br></br>In my spare time I make props, do performance and paint. <br></br>I
					also design video game characters...so, watch this space!
					<br></br>
					<br></br>I like to approach everything I do with a playful, curious attitude
					that retains the wonder of noticing. <br></br>This means that I tend to be
					pretty good at problem solving and identifying solutions that fall outside of
					the hypothetical box.
					<br></br>
					<br></br> During various freelance jobs I have become aware that a big aspect of
					good branding has a lot to do with how you make people feel. <br></br>I like to
					make people feel seen and heard and collaborate in an open and holistic way that
					empowers others to see their vision come to life.
					<br></br>
					<br></br> I also have a cat. <br></br> His name is mr. Big Stretch. <br></br>He
					is the worst. <br></br>
					<br></br>
